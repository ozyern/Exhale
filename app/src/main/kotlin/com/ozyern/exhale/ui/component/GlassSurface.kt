/**
 * The app's glass plate, as one modifier.
 *
 * Three things together are what make a rectangle read as glass rather than as a grey box: a
 * *gradient* fill so the top catches more light than the bottom, a bright hairline rim that fades
 * out down the same axis, and enough translucency that whatever is painted behind the card bleeds
 * through. Miss any one of them and it stops working — a flat translucent fill with no rim is just
 * a smudge, and an opaque fill with a rim is a bevel.
 *
 * [LiquidGlassSheet] carries its own copy of this recipe tuned for a full-width sheet against a
 * scrim. This one is for cards sitting on a page, and is shared by Sound Chem's capsule deck and
 * the Updates page so the two cannot drift apart.
 *
 * Cards using this need something behind them worth seeing — a colour wash, artwork, a blur. On a
 * flat `surface` page there is nothing for the translucency to reveal, and the card lands as a
 * grey smudge with a bright edge. [base] is the way out of that: an opaque-ish tonal floor laid
 * under the glass so the plate is guaranteed to exist whatever is or is not behind it. Pass it
 * for controls that have to work on every screen in the app (see `LiquidBackButton`); leave it
 * unspecified for cards that are only ever placed over artwork, where a floor would just throw
 * away the effect.
