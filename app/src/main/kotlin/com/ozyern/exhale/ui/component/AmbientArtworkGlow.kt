/**
 * A soft wash of the current artwork's colour bleeding down from the top of a scrolling surface.
 *
 * Home was a flat sheet: correct, and completely inert. This puts the record back in the room —
 * the surface picks up whatever is playing, the way light takes the colour of what it falls on,
 * and the screen stops looking like a list on a void.
 *
 * Built to be cheap enough to leave running:
 *
 *  * **Three radial blobs, no blur.** A radial gradient's falloff is already softer than any blur
 *    kernel, so a RenderEffect here would cost a full-screen pass every frame and change nothing
 *    you can see. The player's backdrop makes the same trade for the same reason.
 *  * **Drifting, but only in the draw phase.** The blobs wander a lap every thirty-odd seconds.
 *    This was static at first, on the argument that animating a full-screen effect on the tab the
 *    app opens on is a cost paid forever to move something nobody is watching — and the second
 *    half of that is right, which is what the speed is for: at this rate you cannot catch it
 *    moving, you only ever notice the page is not where you left it. What made it affordable is
 *    that every animated value is read inside the draw lambda, so a frame costs one layer
 *    invalidation and repaints three gradients — no recomposition, no relayout, and nothing at all
 *    for the list scrolling above it. The alternative reading of "static" was a page that is lit
 *    by the record when you arrive and then frozen, which is the exact quality a printed screen
 *    has and a room does not.
 *  * **One clock for every copy.** The drift phase comes from the shared infinite-animation frame
 *    clock, not a per-instance transition, because two copies of this are sometimes meant to be one
 *    wash — see SettingsBarGround.
 *  * **Nothing playing, nothing drawn.** With no colours the layer returns before allocating a
 *    brush.
 *
 * Each blob is painted across the *whole* surface rather than into a band. Clipping to a band is
 * the obvious way to keep the wash at the top, and it is wrong: wherever a blob's falloff has not
 * finished by the band's edge it gets cut by a straight line, which is precisely the seam the
 * effect exists to avoid. The gradients reach transparent on their own, so position and radius are
 * what confine them — nothing has to be clipped at all.
