/**
 * "Apple Music" tap physics — scale down on press, spring back on release.
 *
 * Everything runs inside [graphicsLayer], so the animation is GPU-only: it skips the
 * composition and layout phases (never animate size/padding for this).
 *
 * Two entry points depending on whether the caller already owns the click:
 *  - [pressScale]: couple the scale to an existing clickable's [InteractionSource].
 *  - [pressScaleContainer]: self-contained observer for containers whose click/scroll is
 *    handled by a child (e.g. list/grid rows that receive a clickable via their modifier).
 *  - [bounceClick]: all-in-one clickable + scale for new call sites.
 *
 * INSTANT TOUCH: [pressScaleContainer] (and therefore [bounceClick]) drive the scale from a
 * pointer observer on the Initial pass, so it fires on ACTION_DOWN with ZERO delay. This is
 * deliberately NOT tied to `clickable`'s [InteractionSource], because Compose delays the
 * press interaction by ~100 ms inside scrollables to disambiguate tap-vs-scroll — which is
 * exactly the "doesn't respond to every rapid tap" lag we want to eliminate.

/**
 * All-in-one: INSTANT press physics (scale on ACTION_DOWN) + [combinedClickable] ripple/click.
 * The scale comes from [pressScaleContainer] (Initial-pass observer, no tap-slop delay), while
 * the clickable still provides ripple indication and the click/long-click semantics.
 *
 * ### Always pass [shape] when the target is not a rectangle
 *
 * A ripple is drawn by the indication node and clipped by whatever clip is **above** it in the
 * chain. Every glass surface in this app clips itself, and the idiom at all six call sites was
 *
 * ```
 * Modifier.size(38.dp).bounceClick(onClick).liquidGlassSurface(CircleShape)
 * ```
 *
 * which puts the clip *below* the clickable — so the ripple was never clipped at all. Tapping the
 * account disc washed a hard-edged **square** across a circular button, and the same square landed
 * on every rounded card in the account sheet, including the one whose comment says a stray ripple
 * is the cheapest-looking thing in a glass UI.
 *
 * Clipping inside `bounceClick`, before the indication, fixes it wherever the caller says what
 * shape it is. The default stays null so nothing rectangular pays for a graphics layer it does
 * not need.
